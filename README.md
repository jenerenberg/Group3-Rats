# Group 3 - Rats
**"The Rat King of NYC"**

**BRIEF DESCRIPTION:**
New York City is infamous for its abundance of rodents and other varying pests roaming the streets. In response, many will send in service requests through the 311 line in hopes of reducing the ever-boading presence of these rats. For this project, Group 3 asks the questions: **How do 311 rodent-related service requests vary between NYC boroughs? What months receive the most, as well as the least, rat service requests from the public?**
